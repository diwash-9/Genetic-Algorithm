Overview
This repository contains a Python implementation of a genetic algorithm (GA) designed to optimize a user-defined function. Genetic algorithms are stochastic search algorithms inspired by the process of natural selection and evolution.

The genetic algorithm implemented here follows these general steps:

Initialization: Generate an initial population of potential solutions encoded as binary strings.
Selection: Use a fitness-based selection method (roulette wheel selection) to choose individuals for reproduction.
Crossover: Apply uniform crossover to selected parents to create offspring.
Mutation: Introduce random mutations in offspring to maintain genetic diversity.
Fitness Evaluation: Evaluate the fitness of each individual using a user-defined fitness function.
Iteration: Repeat the selection, crossover, and mutation process over multiple generations to evolve solutions towards an optimal or near-optimal solution.
